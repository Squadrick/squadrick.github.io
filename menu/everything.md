This includes a list of cool things I would like to have saved, as well as
tiny thoughts that don't warrant a full blog post.

I accidentally deleted 6 hours of uncommitted work:

```
~/W/shadesmar> rm -rf *
zsh: sure you want to delete all 21 files in /home/squadrick/Workspace/shadesmar [yn]? y
```

I thought I was in `build` deleting compiled targets. Time to retype from memory.
