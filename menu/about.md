title: About Me.
---

I'm Dheeraj. I'm a computer science undergrad. I like doing coding stuffs. 

I like open source software. I'm a maintainer of [TensorFlow Addons](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/), and I contribute to other projects: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jax, etc.  I occasionally work on a few side projects which you can check out on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Squadrick). 

I'm currently interning at [ThoughtSpot](https://www.thoughtspot.com/) building an AI for BI. I was part of my university's [AI Robotics Team](http://projectmanas.in), where we worked on building an autonomous car, and won [IGVC 2019](http://www.igvc.org/). I've had a few interships over the four years of college, mostly focusing on ML. You can check my [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2240521/squadrick?tab=profile) to see what's been puzzling me lately. If you're looking to hire me, here's my (slightly outdated) [Résumé](https://squadrick.github.io/Resume.pdf).

I enjoy reading high fantasy and sci-fi books. I'm currently reading: Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen. I used to be an avid gamer until I bricked my PC, so now I'm playing DnD. 

This is a blog about coding and computers. I'll be writing about my solutions to unique problems I face. I generally try to avoid writing an article if something similar exists. I usually do a bit of searching before writing a blog to see if someone else has written about it before.
