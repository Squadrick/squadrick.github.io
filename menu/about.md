title: Welcome to my blog!

I'm Dheeraj! I'm a computer science undergrad slogging through classes half awake. I was born and brought up in Bangalore, India. Currently I study at Manipal Institute of Technology. Here's my (slightly outdated) [Résumé](https://github.com/Squadrick/squadrick.github.io/raw/gh-pages/Resume.pdf).

I'm part of my university's [AI Robotics Team](http://projectmanas.in), I've interned at a few places including [Swish](http://theswishapp.io/), [RazorThink](https://www.razorthink.com/) and [Ganit Labs](https://www.ganitlabs.in), I'm part of my university's [ACM Student Chapter](https://manipal.acm.org), and I do some competitive coding. I also ask and answer questions on
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2240521/squadrick?tab=profile).

I'm also a big supporter of open source software. I've contributed to a few projects: TensorFlow, PyTorch Glow, Google Jax, etc. I'm a subpackage maintainer of [TensorFlow Addons](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/). I occasionally write a few fun side projects which you can check out on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Squadrick) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Squadrick).

I like watching films, I listen to all kinds of music especially if it has some electronic distortion and I waste hours on xkcd/reddit. I enjoy reading high fantasy and sci-fi (cyberpunk ftw) books. I'm currently reading Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen. I play some video games when I have the time. I'm currently playing Katana Zero and Moonlighter.

This blog will be a tad bit on the technical side, with some sprinkling of other random mental ramblings. I'll mostly be writing about machine and deep learing, robotics and new stuff that I've learnt.
