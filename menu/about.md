title: Welcome to my blog!

I'm Dheeraj! I'm a computer science undergrad slogging through classes half awake. I was born and brought up in Bangalore, India. Currently I study at Manipal Institute of Technology. Here's my [Résumé](https://github.com/Squadrick/squadrick.github.io/raw/gh-pages/Resume.pdf).

I'm part of my university's [AI Robotics Team](http://projectmanas.in), I work as an ML engineer for [Swish](http://theswishapp.io), I'm part of my university's [ACM Student Chapter](https://manipal.acm.org), I occasionally write a few fun side projects which you can check out on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Squadrick) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Squadrick), and I do some competitive coding (not to brag, but ICPC Regionals '17). I also ask and answer some questions on
[Stack Overflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2240521/squadrick?tab=profile)

I like watching films, I listen to all kinds of music especially if it has some electronic distortion and I waste hours on xkcd/reddit. 

I enjoy reading high fantasy and sci-fi (cyberpunk ftw) books. I'm currently making my way through Brandon Sanderson's The Stormlight Archive series. I'm thoroughly enjoying it.

This blog will be a tad bit on the technical side, with some sprinkling of other random mental ramblings. I'll mostly be writing about machine and deep learing, robotics and new stuff that I've learnt.
