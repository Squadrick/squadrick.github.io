title: About Me
---

I'm Dheeraj, and I commonly use Squadrick as my internet moniker. I'm a computer science undergrad. I like doing coding stuffs.

I like open source software. I used to be a  maintainer of [TensorFlow Addons](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/), and I contribute to other projects: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jax, etc. I occasionally work on a few side projects which you can check out on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Squadrick).

I'm currently working at [ThoughtSpot](https://www.thoughtspot.com/) building AI for BI. I was part of my university's [AI Robotics Team](http://projectmanas.in), where we worked on building an autonomous car, and won [IGVC 2019](http://www.igvc.org/). I've had a few interships over the four years of college, mostly focusing on ML.

I enjoy reading high fantasy and sci-fi books. I'm currently reading Steven Erikson's *Malazan Book of the Fallen*. ~~I used to be an avid gamer until I bricked my PC, so now I'm playing DnD.~~ I got a [new PC](https://squadrick.dev/journal/new-pc.html), and I'm back to gaming with my friends; I'm still playing DnD though. 

This is a blog about coding and computers. I'll be writing about my solutions to unique problems I face. I generally try to avoid writing an article if something similar exists. I also post random thoughts and updates on my feed.

If you're looking to hire me, here's my (slightly outdated) [résumé](https://squadrick.github.io/Resume.pdf).
