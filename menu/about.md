title: About Me
---

I'm Dheeraj, and I commonly use _Squadrick_ as my internet moniker. I'm from BLR, and I now live in SF Bay Area.

I spend many hours each week trying to get computers to understand me.

I like open source software. I used to be a  maintainer of [TensorFlow Addons](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/), and I contribute to other OSS projects. I occasionally work on a few side projects which you can check out on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Squadrick), notably [Shadesmar](https://github.com/Squadrick/shadesmar), [SummaryDB](https://github.com/Squadrick/summarydb) and [Retrograde](https://github.com/Squadrick/Retrograde). My interests in the field of computers: Distributed systems, ML, rendering engines, build systems, high-performance computing. 

I work at [ThoughtSpot](https://www.thoughtspot.com/) as a software engineer. My work here spans a lot of domains: ML, databases, search, build systems, APIs, making code go brrr, and a bunch of other random things along the way. I also helped found the production engineering team, which worked alongside our SRE and R&D teams to ensure our search and data systems didn't crash and burn.

I was a part of my university's [AI Robotics Team](http://projectmanas.in), where we worked on building an autonomous car and won [IGVC 2019](http://www.igvc.org/). I've had a few interships over my four years of undergrad, mostly focusing on ML.

This is a blog about coding and computers. I love solving problems that span across computing abstractions, which is what I'll be writing about. I generally try to avoid writing an article if something similar exists. I also post random thoughts and updates on my [feed](https://squadrick.dev/menu/feed.html).

If you're looking to hire me, here's my (slightly outdated) [résumé](https://squadrick.github.io/resume).

When I'm not working with computers, it's usually: books (sci-fi, fantasy), video games, beer, meditation or badminton.
