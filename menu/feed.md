A running list in the intersection of things I want to remember and
things I don't mind the internet knowing about me.

I recently got a new PC. To play games I installed Windows. I hate Windows.
Read [a blog post](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/) that encapsulates why I
hate it. This is similar to another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko)
by Jonathon Blow. That's not to say Windows is the only thing guilty of this, there's
plenty of inefficient, janky softwares I use of a regular basis.

After playing games like Red Dead Redemption 2 over the last couple of days, I'm
gobsmacked by people who write game engines. They are far less guilty of
the above.

I'm going to try [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) now, and try
to get started with some basic game engine work.

I accidentally deleted 6 hours of uncommitted work:

```
~/W/shadesmar> rm -rf *
zsh: sure you want to delete all 21 files in /home/squadrick/Workspace/shadesmar [yn]? y
```

I thought I was in `build` deleting compiled targets. Time to retype from memory.
