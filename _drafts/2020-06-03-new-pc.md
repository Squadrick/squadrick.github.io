I recently spent an entire month's paycheck on a new PC. Before jumping into
it, I wanted to revisit my PC history from the beginning.

The primary use cases for all my PCs have remained consistent over the years:
gaming and coding.

### Prologue: Xerox Shop PCs

My family didn't have a personal computer until I was in fourth grade (2007).
Before that, my (much older) cousins owned an internet caf√©, or as per 
Indian colloquialism, a "Xerox shop". They owned several computers with CRT
monitors. I have no idea what the specs of the machines were. ~~I've asked said
cousins, let's hope they remember.~~ My cousin came through big time, as far as
she can remember it was:
1. Intel Pentium 486
2. 32 or 64MB RAM
3. 32 or 64GB HDD
4. Windows 95/98

The only memories I have is of playing [Road Rash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rash) 
and [Prince of Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)),
or more accurately I would try to play, fail and then my cousins would take
over and finish the level for me.

### Act 1: Noise Box

In 2007, my parents finally bought our family's first PC. Instead of opting
for a standard OEM computer, they bought an assembled PC to save a few precious
rupees. The specs of the computer:
1. Intel Core 2 Duo E4500
2. 1GB DDR2 667 Mhz RAM
3. 160GB HDD
4. Nvidia GeForce GT210 (later addition)
5. (Pirated[^no-piracy]) Windows XP.

Although I strongly advocated for buying a GPU, my parents did not heed the
words of a 9 year old child. Smh. They would reverse this decision in a couple
of years.

The cabinet was a janky, broken piece of shit. The most memorable thing about
the PC was just how noisy the fans were. And that the windows partition would
become full and then not boot, requiring a fresh install of Windows.

Despite it's flaws, this was the PC that got me into both gaming and coding.

On the gaming front, GTA: Vice City[^vc-audio], GTA: San Andreas, NFS
Underground 2, NFS Most Wanted were the defining titles. I also seriously
got into online gaming: every variant of Adventure Quest, RuneScape and
World of Warcraft. I've probably spent over a thousand hours playing those
games. In 2009, I bought GTA 4 for all my saved my birthday money without
understanding the concept of "Minimum Specifications". I was quickly heart
broken to realize my jank-ass PC wasn't going to run GTA 4[^rs] without a
GPU. For nearly a year, GTA 4 remained on a shelf unplayed until my parents
agreed to buy me a GPU: Nvidia GeForce 210. This unlocked a whole new axis
for me. I quickly discovered that the human eye can see beyond 20fps. Due to
the terrible cabinet and lack of proper airflow, the GPU did not last long, it
died in a couple of years and I went back to 20fps gaming.

I also learnt how to code in Java on this PC. Not much else to say, I wrote
shitty programs, but it was my first foray into programming.

I still own all components of the Noise Box. The monitor is used in vertical
orientation, the harddisk is used in my newer PCs and contains my offline music
and movie library, [the processor](https://imgur.com/a/Ym9hZao) stands on my
make shift monitor stand with the future plan of having it cleaned and framed.
The remaining parts are stored in some attic collecting dust.

On a final note, I bought the Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 to play FIFA, and
it works flawlessly to this day. I love Logitech and highly recommend it.

[^no-piracy]: I do not condone piracy now.
[^vc-audio]: Our version of Vice City didn't have audio, so I played the entire game without any sounds whatsoever.
[^rs]: Not to forget the horror that is Rockstar Social Club

### Act 2: PCMR

2012 was the year I discovered reddit, and I quickly joined my favorite
circlejerk community: PC Master Race. This lead me to a rabbit hole of figuring
out PC hardware including LinusTechTips. For fun, I would spec out PCs on
Flipkart at different price points with no intention of buying the PC.

In 2014, right after I finished my 10th grade board exams, I finally ascended.
I bought my new gaming PC:
1. Intel i5 4440
2. 8GB DDR3 1600 Mhz RAM
3. 1TB HDD
4. AMD R9 270X
5. (Pirated[^no-piracy]) Windows 8.1
6. Ubuntu, Arch

I played **a lot** on games on this PC. Too many for me to even list them all,
the memorable ones are Witcher 3, GTA 5, Bioshock Infinite, Skyrim. But the
most important game of all: Battlefield 3. My friends and I played several
hundred hours of BF3 over two years while chatting on Skype. We would all sneak
onto our computers during school nights after our curfew times to play BF3 till
early hours the following day. They went from people I barely knew to them
becoming my best friends. Shoutout to Rakesh, Gokul and Rishav.

This was also my first \*NIX machine, and the machine on which I learnt to 
*properly* write code. I continued writing larger Java projects and dipped
my feet into C and Python as well. I also discovered the use of a terminal
and an IDE, instead of running programs using [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/)
[^icse].

The PC also survived multiple road trips to and from college, I used it for
more compute heavy work and gaming during college along side the *Super
Trooper*. It went through some drastic changes: I uninstalled Windows and
switched to Arch Linux. The GPU was pretty useless for me since I was into
deep learning, but almost all frameworks (TensorFlow, Pytorch) only support
hardware acceleration via CUDA/CuDNN on Nvidia GPUs. It's nice to see this
change recently with ROCm.

Ultimately the PSU gave out, and I realized I needed a new PC with a better
CPU and an Nvidia GPU. I've tested it and all the components work as expected.
I'm trying to sell the machine, so if you or anyone you know is interested in
buying, please contact me.

It lasted a solid 6 years.

[^icse]: Shoutout to the ICSE peeps.
