### Quick-Start Guide

To start using Jekyll right away, [fork the Lagrange repository on GitHub](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange/fork). From there, you can rename the repository to 'USERNAME.github.io', where 'USERNAME' is your GitHub username, and edit the `_config.yml` file to your liking. Ensure that you have a branch named `gh-pages`. Your website should be ready immediately at 'http://USERNAME.github.io'.

Head over to the `_posts` directory to view all the posts that are currently on the website, and to see examples of what post files generally look like. You can simply just duplicate the template post and start adding your own content.

### Full Installation Guide

For a full local installation of Lagrange, [download your own copy of Lagrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange/archive/gh-pages.zip) and unzip it into it's own directory. From there, open up your favorite command line tool, and enter `jekyll serve`. Your site should be up and running locally at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

The same process follows from above for adding new posts and content to your site. For a full guide on using Lagrange, check out the [Working With Jekyll]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2015-11-11-Working-With-Jekyll %}) post.
