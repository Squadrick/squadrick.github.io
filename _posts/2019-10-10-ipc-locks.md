Interprocess message passing is an important tool, especially when
developing large complex systems like robots. [ROS](https://www.ros.org)
is commonly used for pretty much every small/medium scale robot, and it's
no different at [Project MANAS](http://projectmanas.in/) where we were using
ROS across the board. ROS uses a [publish-subscribe paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish–subscribe_pattern) for communicating between messages, and
internally it uses either TCP/IP or UDP, which are both quite slow
compared to using, say, the system's shared memory.

I decided to build a small simple IPC library that uses the same pub-sub
pattern, but using shared memory instead. I call this library
[Shadesmar](https://github.com/squadrick/shadesmar), and it's mostly used
for transporting large messages (pointclouds, images) between processes
and it works quite well with our pre-existing ROS codebase.

The reason I implemented the library from scratch
instead of using Boost's [`message_queue`](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_40_0/doc/html/boost/interprocess/message_queue.html) was that we needed the ability to
do memory copies from GPU to shared memory and vice-versa, without the
need to do an intermediate copy to the process's memory space.

So we can achieve:
```
GPU -> Shared Memory -> GPU
```
instead of
```
GPU -> Process Memory -> Shared Memory -> Process Memory -> GPU
```

The implementation of Shadesmar (`shm`) is quite simple. We allocate
a large chunk of system memory using the topic name as the key, and the
memory is used as a circular buffer. Each publisher (writer) writes at the
last index position, overwriting older pre-existing data. The subscribes
regularly poll to know if there's been a new message and copy the
message if there's a new message. Alternatively, I provide the ability
to do serialization using the excellent library [msgpack](https://msgpack.org).
You can find the full details of the implementation in the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/squadrick/shadesmar), but moving onto the
title of the blog post: Interprocess Locks

### Interprocess Synchronization

Since multiple publishers and subscribers have the ability to read and write
from the same memory buffer, there's a possibility of data corruption if
the reads and writes overlap. To prevent this, each publisher acquires an
exclusive lock for the buffer, writes the data and unlock the lock. Since
the subscribers are read-only, they acquire a shared lock on the buffer,
read the data and unlock the lock.

Boost has an [interprocess sharable mutex](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_52_0/doc/html/boost/interprocess/interprocess_sha_id1076961.html) that can be stored on shared memory, and it is perfect
for this.


Psuedo-code for reading and writing:

```c++
// buffer is the shared memory circular queue

void read(MessageType *msg, int idx) {
  ipc_mut->lock_sharable();
  memcpy(buffer[idx], msg, sizeof(MessageType));
  ipc_mut->unlock_sharable();
}

void write(MessageType *msg) {
  int idx = get_last_idx();
  ipc_mut->lock();
  memcpy(msg, buffer[idx], sizeof(MessageType));
  ipc_mut->unlock();
}
```

This would work fine as long as we can assume that no process involved
in this communication will crash or be killed. This, unfortunately,
is not something we can guarantee, as simply `Ctrl+C`ing a running process
will cause this to fail.


#### Failure

If a process dies while having exclusive or shared access to `ipc_mut` and
it dies, then any other process trying to acquire this process will
starve, causing the system to halt. We could assume that if a process fails to
acquire access to `ipc_mut` in a small time span, the process previously
holding `ipc_mut` is now dead so we forcefully acquire access and proceed with
the read/write operation. However, this could lead to overlaps if the
operation of the previous process took longer than the time span we waited.

There are a number of ways to tackle this problem, and I'll be first
talking about my approach, followed by other approaches.

#### Approach

I create a new lock type called `robust_ipc_mutex` that can handle the
death of underlying processes. It keeps track of PID of the last process
that acquired it, and if another process can't acquire it, it can
check if the PID is still alive using `stat`, if it's dead it will unlock
the mutex and reset the field of the previous owner.

```c++
class robust_ipc_mutex {
public:  
  robust_ipc_mutex() = default;

  void lock() {
    // in a spin lock until we get access
    while(!mut.try_lock()) {
      if (exclusive_owner != 0) {
        if (proc_dead(exclusive_owner)) {
          exclusive_owner = 0;
          mut.unlock();
          continue;
        }
      }
      std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(TIMEOUT));
    }
    exclusive_owner = getpid();
  }

  void unlock() {
    exclusive_owner = 0;
    mut.unlock();
  }

private:
  interprocess_sharable_mutex mut;
  __pid_t exclusive_owner{0};
}
```

Although the above code looks correct, it can lead to faults by unlocking
`mut` more than necessary. Assume the following order of execution by 2 processes,
when they call `lock`, and `exclusive_owner` is dead.

```c++
// TIMESTEP 1
while(!mut.try_lock()) {                //<-- proc 1 (enters the loop)
  if (exclusive_owner != 0) {           //<-- proc 2 (enters the if)
    if (proc_dead(exclusive_owner)) {
      exclusive_owner = 0;
      mut.unlock();
      continue;
    }
  }
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(TIMEOUT));
}


// TIMESTEP 2
while(!mut.try_lock()) {                 
  if (exclusive_owner != 0) {           //<-- proc 1 (enters the if)
    if (proc_dead(exclusive_owner)) {   //<-- proc 2 (enters the if, since exclusive_owner is dead)
      exclusive_owner = 0;
      mut.unlock();
      continue;
    }
  }
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(TIMEOUT));
}


// TIMESTEP 3
while(!mut.try_lock()) {                 
  if (exclusive_owner != 0) {           
    if (proc_dead(exclusive_owner)) {   //<-- proc 1 (enters the if, if proc 1 runs before proc 2)
      exclusive_owner = 0;              //<-- proc 2 (might run after proc 1)
      mut.unlock();
      continue;
    }
  }
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(TIMEOUT));
}

```

After timestep 3, both proc 1 and 2 call `mut.unlock()` which is incorrect.
Further, `exclusive_owner` is reset to 0 twice instead of once as expected. This
condition arises dues to the lack of atomicity of the operations leading to
interleaved execution. We can tackle the issue by using C++'s `atomic` functionality.

Instead of simply assigning `exclusive_owner = 0`, we use a CAS to ensure
atomicity across processes.

```c++
class robust_ipc_mutex {
public:  
  robust_ipc_mutex() = default;

  void lock() {
    // in a spin lock until we get access
    while(!mut.try_lock()) {
      if (exclusive_owner != 0) {
        auto ex_proc = exclusive_owner.load(); // atomic load
        if (proc_dead(ex_proc)) {
          if (exclusive_owner.compare_exchange_strong(ex_proc, 0)) {
            // ensures that the process which we checked for liveness
            // is the same as the value we're replacing

            // if the condition returns false
            // exclusive_owner was reset by some other process
            mut.unlock();
            continue;
          }
        }
      }
      std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(TIMEOUT));
    }
    exclusive_owner = getpid();
  }

  void unlock() {
    auto current_pid = getpid();
    if (exclusive_owner.compare_exchange_strong(current_pid, 0)) {
      mut.unlock();
    }
  }

private:
  interprocess_sharable_mutex mut;
  std::atomic<__pid_t> exclusive_owner{0};
}
```

Using `atomic`, we can guarantee that `lock` and `unlock` work even
if the process dies. This only tackles the problem of exclusive access
where only one process can hold the lock. We also need to add the
ability to have shared access (`lock_sharable`, `unlock_sharable`). This
is a little tough since we need to keep track of multiple shared
processes instead of a single exclusive process, and like above, we need
to ensure that the data structure we use to store the shared processes
are correct under concurrent use without the use of any locks. I'll build
a simple lock-less linear set for this. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ-719EGIts)
is a great video of building a lock-free hash table which is where I started off
when learning how to build this data structure.

#### Lockless Set

The set needs to be able to insert PIDs, delete PIDs, and traverse
through the set.

```c++
template <uint32_t max_size>
class LocklessSet {
public:
  LocklessSet();

  void insert(uint32_t);

  bool remove(uint32_t);

  std::atomic<uint32_t> pids[max_size];
}
```

(NOTE: I used a linear set since `max_size` is very small (32), but the
implementation can be easily expanded to make a hash-set with closed hashing.)

The constructor initializes `pids` to the default value of `0`.

```c++
LocklessSet() {
  std::memset(pids, 0, max_size);
}
```

`insert` and `remvoe` use atomic CAS for inserting the elements concurrently.

```c++
bool insert(uint32_t elem) {
  for (uint32_t idx = 0; idx < size; ++idx) {
    auto probedElem = pids[idx].load();

    if (probedElem != elem) {
      // The entry is either free or contains another key
      if (probedElem != 0) {
        continue; // contains another key
      }
      // Entry is free, time for CAS
      // probedKey or pids[idx] is expected to be zero
      uint32_t exp = 0;
      if (pids[idx].compare_exchange_strong(exp, elem)) {
        // successfully insert the element
        return true;
      } else {
        // some other proc got to it before us, continue searching
        continue;
      }
    }
    // no space in the set
    return false;
  }
}

bool remove(uint32_t elem) {
  for (uint32_t idx = 0; idx < size; ++idx) {
    auto probedElem = pids[idx].load();

    if (probedElem == elem) {
      return pids[idx].compare_exchange_strong(elem, 0);
      // if true, we successfully do a CAS and the element was deleted by current proc
      // if false, some other proc deleted the element before
    }
  }

  // we exit after doing a full pass through the array
  // but we failed to delete an element, maybe already deleted
  return false;
}
```

We can use `LocklessSet` to build `lock_sharable` and `unlock_sharable` into
`robust_ipc_mutex`. We also need to modify `lock` to take
the shared processes into account.

```c++
class robust_ipc_mutex {
public:  
  robust_ipc_mutex() = default;

  void lock();

  void unlock();

  void lock_sharable();

  void unlock_sharable();

private:
  void prune_sharable_procs();

  LocklessSet<32> shared_owners;
  interprocess_sharable_mutex mut;
  __pid_t exclusive_owner{0};
}
```

`prune_sharable_procs` iterates through the set and atomically removes
dead processes that are holding a shared access on the lock.

```c++
void prune_sharable_procs() {
  for (auto &i : shared_owners.__array) {
    uint32_t shared_owner = i.load();

    if (shared_owner == 0)
      continue;
    if (proc_dead(shared_owner)) {
      if (shared_owners.remove(shared_owner)) {
        // removal of element was a success
        // this ensures no duplicate deletion
        mutex_.unlock_sharable();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In `lock` if we fail to get exclusive access, and `exclusive_owner = 0`, we
can `prune_sharable_procs` to remove any dead processes.


```c++
void lock() {
  while (!mutex_.try_lock()) {
    // failed to get mutex_ within timeout,
    // so mutex_ is either held properly
    // or some process which holds it has died
    if (exclusive_owner != 0) {
      // exclusive_owner is not default value, some other proc
      // has access already
      auto ex_proc = exclusive_owner.load();
      if (proc_dead(ex_proc)) {
        // ex_proc is dead, we unlock
        // and continue immediately to next loop
        if (exclusive_owner.compare_exchange_strong(ex_proc, 0)) {
          mutex_.unlock();
          continue;
        }
      }
    } else {
      // exclusive_owner = 0, so the writers are blocking us
      prune_sharable_procs();
    }
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(TIMEOUT));
  }

  // only a single proc can get here at a time
  exclusive_owner = getpid();
}
```

`lock_sharable` is similar to `lock`, but we only need to check
for `exclusive_owner`.

```c++
void lock_sharable() {
  while (!mutex_.try_lock_sharable()) {
    // only reason for failure is that exclusive lock is held
    if (exclusive_owner != 0) {
      auto ex_proc = exclusive_owner.load();
      if (proc_dead(ex_proc)) {
        // exclusive_owner is dead
        if (exclusive_owner.compare_exchange_strong(ex_proc, 0)) {
          exclusive_owner = 0;
          mutex_.unlock();
        }
      }
    }
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(TIMEOUT));
  }

  // loop until we insert our
  while(!shared_owners.insert(getpid()));
}
```

We use `LocklessSet`'s `remove` to delete the current PID when `unlock_sharable`
is called.

```c++
void unlock_sharable() {
  if (shared_owners.remove(getpid())) {
    mutex_.unlock_sharable();
  }
}
```

`robust_ipc_mutex` can be placed in the shared memory segment that
you're trying to synchronize.

#### Performance

I created a benchmark to calculate the time for various operations compared to
a basic `interprocess_sharable_mutex`. `robust_ipc_mutex` can handle up to
64 shared processes and `TIMEOUT` is set as 1 μs.

Locking and unlocking continuously for 1000000 times:
```
Base mutex: 95656.8 ± 9585.832 μs
Robust mutex: 1176544.0 ± 19633.354 μs
```

Shared locking and unlocking continuously for 1000000 times:
```
Base mutex: 80629.0 ± 3651.181 μs
Robust mutex: 1172940.6 ± 7039.073 μs
```

`robust_ipc_mutex` is 12-15x slower compared to the underlying base
mutex.

Within `shadesmar` we replaced the base mutex with the robust mutex,
the number of messages of size 7 bytes written in 1 ms (1 publisher, 1 subscriber)
are reported below:

```
Base mutex: 206335.2 ± 5148.852
Robust mutex: 167751.4 ± 1717.818
```


`robust_ipc_mutex` is around 1.25x slower than the base mutex.

From synthetic benchmarks, it seems that `robust_ipc_mutex` is quite slow
compared to using the base mutex, but in a more realistic scenario the difference
is not found at all.

Publishing message of size 10000000 bytes from 1 publisher to 8 subscribers
with message serialization (using msgpack). Below are the messages sent
in 1 s:

```
Base mutex: 533.0 ± 34.438
Modified mutex: 521.0 ± 10.358
```

The difference between the two is far smaller, and since the typical
message size that Shadesmar will transport will be in the order of several
megabytes (uncompressed images/pointclouds/tensors), the time trade-off is
worth the robustness.

### Other Approaches

This isn't the only way to solve this problem. While researching if someone
else has already tackled a similar problem, I stumbled upon other possible
solutions:

1. POSIX's `pthread` can be made robust using `pthread_mutexattr_setrobust`,
where if a thread holding the mutex dies, a waiting thread receives
`EOWNERDEAD`. The waiting thread acquires the mutex, and it is its
responsibility to make the mutex consistent using `pthread_mutex_consistent`.
By default, `pthread`s can't be used between process via shared memory,
but it can be set to work in shared memory using `pthread_mutexattr_setpshared`.
`pthread`s support very basic sync mechanism and a sharable mutex should be built
using a `pthread` taking `EOWNERDEAD` into consideration. I'm currently working
on this as an alternative robust IPC lock, and I'll make a blog post when I'm done.

2. Using a centralized process for tracking processes. We register
each process using the mutex with the `master`. The `maser` creates a
non-blocking TCP socket with a registering process. The `master` will
try to read data from the socket. If the other process is read, it reads 0 bytes.
If the other process is alive, it gets `EWOULDBLOCK`. The `master` would regularly
check that all registered processes are alive, and clean up any dead process
and make the mutex consistent.
