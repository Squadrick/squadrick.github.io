I turned 21 this year, which makes 2010-2019 the most formative decade
of my life so far. This post is to outline the highlights in my life 
over the last 10 years. However, I'm limited by my own memory, and I've
probably forgotten some things, but if I don't remember them then let's 
hope they aren't that important.

### Moved Houses

The first major event of this decade is our family moving homes. We shifted
from my budding childhood home where I resided till around the age of 12. 

I loved my old house, I was surrounded by kids of my age who went to schools
close by. I would walk home after school everyday. We played till the 
sun set or till our feet hurt. We used to play with neighbours who were 
much older than me, like 4-5 years; they tried their best to include us, 
but in hindsight we were annoying little runts. I was also very prone 
to injuring myself, and I broke my hand in 2010. I truly love my old neighbours 
and neighbourhood. I have far too many memories to put down into a single 
post. I wish I'd stayed in touch with them better, and visited a little
more often. 

When I moved houses, the amount of time I spent playing outside essentially
hit zero. I instead started spending more time at home on the computer. 
It wasn't that there weren't people my age in my new neighbourhood, but I 
went from a very close-knit group where I was part of the inner circle to
being the new kid that didn't get the inside jokes. This made me quite 
reclusive for a few years, and lead me to put on quite a bit of weight
that I still haven't worked off. 

This went on for the first 2-3 years until I made some friends from 
my school van. After that I pretty much exclusively hung out with them, 
and we still do meet all of us end up back home at the same point. In 
recent times that's becoming increasingly rare due to college/work 
obligations in different parts of the country and world.

I do remember my old friends visiting my new house for the first time. 
I had just started learning how to drive a bike, and I while giving a 
couple of them a ride, I crashed and wrecked my knee. Good times.

### Finished Schooling

From kindergarten to 12th grade, I went to the exact same school --
Bethany High School in Bangalore. Majority of my life was spent there, and 
it was truly a fantastic experience. 

I was a text-book above average kid. I performed well enough in classes. 
I wasn't too great at sports, but I wasn't too bad either. I was 
constantly chided by teachers for talking in class. Apart from that, I 
don't remember anything too memorable. I wasn't a "cool" kid, but I was friends 
with "cool" kids. I also now realize most of my "cool" friends were just
assholes. I do remember enjoying math, physics and computer science 
more than the other subjects, and I scored better in these subjects too.

I was quite unhappy in 2013-14 when I was in 9th/10th grade. I don't recall 
any single friend group that I truly belonged to, I just got along with a 
bunch of different groups. I did have good friends though, but over the years
I've lost touch with most of them. I follow some of them on Instagram, but
I miss just hanging out during class hours or during the lunch break. The
ones I've stayed friends with from 10th grade are now my closest
friends (shoutout Karthik, Rishav, Gokul).

After 10th grade most of my peers decided to move to other schools/
pre-university colleges. I chose to continue in the same school, and elected
to study science + CS. This was also when I truly decided that I wanted to 
pursue CS full time. 

11th and 12th grade was so much more different than 10th grade and earlier. 
There were around 25 kids in my class, and I was close to everyone. Also, 
I had the best teacher of life as my chemistry teacher which was wonderful. 
This was also the year when people started getting serious about their 
futures. I bought into the peer pressure and decided to join "coaching" classes.
In classes I joined in 11th were a complete waste of money. I attended
probably around 40% of the classes, they were both too complex and I 
didn't care enough to keep up. In 12th grade, I decided to just study on
my own, and I'm glad I took that call. I instead spent my time just 
chilling, coding, gaming and all-in-all having an absolutely great time. 

I did start thinking for myself a lot more in the last two years. I think 
I figured out what critical thinking was. I also got a lot better at academics 
and was awarded a 20k scholarship for being the best student in science. 

I graduated in May 2016 after 14 long years in Bethany. Looking back, I 
enjoyed my school years (except the overzealous religious preaching).

and as a hobby. I know, I should diversify. I first learned coding in 
7th grade by doing basic Java.

I'm excited for what the next decade holds for me. 2010-2019 was brilliant, 
but it's also the first decade I properly remember, so it's not much of a 
comparision. 

I can only hope that 2020-2029 will go easy on me. I'm gonna start working from
next week, I'll graduate Manipal. I might go for my masters or continue 
working. I'd gonna make damn sure to stay in touch with the friends I have
from this decade.
