I've recently spent a lot more time contributing to open source software. 
One of the major projects is [TensorFlow Addons](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons),
which a SIG that basically replaces the old `tf.contrib` for TensorFlow 2.
I was fortunate enough to be made a maintainer of the project.

We recently released [this blog](https://medium.com/tensorflow/introducing-tensorflow-addons-6131a50a3dcf) 
which talks about Addons in details.
