## [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

My personal favourite for learning full-stack web development. They offer a great front and back-end curriculum that requires you to complete a variety of projects in order to apply the knowledge that you learn during the lessons.

## [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

Not only does Codecademy have many great courses on various web development languages such as HTML and CSS, but they even offer a course on how to deploy a Jekyll site.

## [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

A great resource not only for learning mathematics (what most people know Khan Academy for), but also computer programming. They offer a variety of courses in JavaScript and even an introduction to algorithms.
